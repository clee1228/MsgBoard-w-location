# Location Based Message Board
A location-based message board application that allows users to post comments when in range of certain landmarks, using a cloud-hosted database (Google Firebase).
Users are able to see how far away they are from all landmarks, but cannot comment or view comments made at a landmark unless they are within 10 meters of the landmark.
